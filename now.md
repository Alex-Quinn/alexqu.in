<h4>Outside</h4>

<p>
The spring climbing season for me has been dominated by boulderingâ€”mostly at <a class="inline-link" href="https://www.mountainproject.com/area/106122647/alderferthree-sisters-park" target="_blank">Three Sisters</a> due to its proximity to Golden. I'm <em>really</em> bad at bouldering so it has been a fun and frustrating learning experience. Working on the weaknesses!
</p>

<p>
I'm planning on refocusing on sport climbing as soon as <a class="inline-link" href="https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105744261/devils-head" target="_blank">Devil's Head</a> opens for the season. I have a few goal routes in mind but nothing super concrete yet.

<h4>Other Stuff</h4>

<p>
I'm still happily building the engineering team at <a class="inline-link" href="https://www.wundercapital.com/" target="_blank">Wunder</a>. At a small company, things are constantly changing and there is always something exciting around the corner. Right now is no exception.

<p>
Finally, Sara and I are moving to Fayetteville, WV (home of the <a class="inline-link" href="https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105855991/the-new-river-gorge" target="_blank">New River Gorge</a>) at the end of July! We're really stoked but the next two months are going to be a bit hectic.
